# Tyop

## A lightweight way to send corrections in the browser

*Updated 02 August 2013*

I was recently reminded by a [post](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2013/05/28/collective-editorial-the-plugin/) by Eric Meyer on a crowdsourced way of catching typos. When I post something on [my blog](http://kellenfujimoto.com/tagged/blog), I tend to obsessively check for errors, ask fellow English nerds for help, and generally take a louse-comb to it. However, it's simply impossible to catch every speech-o out there, and readers can be very helpful in finding errors. Private feedback is always helpful, and clogging-up comment threads with "you accidentally a word" is a waste of everyone's time, so a streamlined method that doesn't get in the reader's way is important.

Currently, pressing the submit button will take the user to an email with some boilerplate that explains the problem. I'd like to implement a more streamlined solution, but this gets the basic concept down.
